# A TOUR OF GO

This is my take on [tour of go](https://tour.golang.org/list) exercises. For more elegant solutions, go check out the [official tour of go repository](https://github.com/golang/tour/tree/master/solutions)

If you want to run the exercises on your local machine, running `go get golang.org/x/tour/gotour` is mandatory as some exercises depend on the binaries being installed locally. Bear in mind that your `$GOPATH` should [correctly be set](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH)

You can also use `make install` to install all needed dependencies
