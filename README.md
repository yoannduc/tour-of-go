# A TOUR OF GO

My take on [tour of go](https://tour.golang.org/list) excercises

If you want to run the excercises on your local machine, running `go get golang.org/x/tour/gotour` is mandatory as some excercises depend on the binaries being installed locally. Bear in mind that your `$GOPATH` should [correctly be set](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH)
